<p><h2 id="p1">Hi! this is my first html website.I know my website in not looking good.</h2>
    <br>
   <h2 id="p2"> My name is Redowan, and I’m a student who loves learning and exploring new ideas. I have a particular interest in history and geography, which often leads me to spend my free time reading about different cultures and ancient civilizations. In school, I always try to participate actively in class discussions and enjoy helping my classmates when they need it.</h2> 
   <br>
   <h2 id="p3">I’m really into gaming. Whether it’s Minecraft (MC), FIFA (FC),Clash of clan (COC), Free Fire (FF), or GTA V, I can spend hours playing these games. But I’m not just about screen time—I also love playing football outside. There’s nothing like the feeling of being on the field, running around, and kicking the ball with friends. Gaming and football are two of my favorite ways to have fun and unwind.</h2>
